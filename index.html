                               This AIIDE workshop is centered on the MARL&Ouml; competition on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Malm&Ouml;. The aim of the competition is to foster research in agents that can learn to play a range of multi-agent games. This workshop is a key opportunity to raise awareness of the competition and associated research challenges within the AIIDE community, to brainstorm and discuss research directions in multi-task, multi-agent learning in modern video games, and to create a fertile ground for novel collaborations.

                            <b>Abstract:</b> Game AI has two defining characteristics. First, is that it is required to 
                            run in real time on machines with limited resources. The other characteristic of traditional 
                            Game AI is that it’s goal isn’t to win, but to maximize player enjoyment. One of the primary 
                            ways it does this is to provide a crafted challenge, matched to the player’s ability, that 
                            they understand, can anticipate, and plan for. These restrictions greatly impact which AI 
                            techniques are suitable and we’ll discuss why certain popular techniques are used. There are 
                            also many challenges in game AI that are active research areas. We’ll discuss these current 
                            challenges and what we are looking for in solutions. Finally, we’ll discuss multiplayer Bot 
                            AI and how it differs from single-player AI and how new technologies like machine learning 
                            could be applied to their development.<br><br>
                            <b>Bio:</b> Jesse Cluff is the Principle Engineering AI Lead at The Coalition. He has been making 
                            games for 20 years, first starting as a Playstation graphics programmer at Radical 
                            Entertainment, but later pursuing AI after being inspired by Minsky’s “Society of Mind”. 
                            He has worked on titles that include Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, Dark Summit, Hulk, The Simpsons:

                            <b>Abstract:</b> AI research has a long history of using games as a measure of progress towards 
                            intelligent machines, but attention has been focused primarily on perfect information games, 
                            like checkers, chess or go. But in real world, one has to deal with imperfect information. Poker 
                            is the quintessential game of imperfect information, where you and your opponent hold information 
                            that each other doesn't have (your cards). DeepStack bridges the gap between AI 
                            techniques for games of perfect information—like checkers, 
                            chess and Go—with ones for imperfect information games–like poker–to reason while it plays using 
                            “intuition” honed through deep learning to reassess its strategy with each decision. DeepStack is 
                            the first theoretically sound application of heuristic search methods—which have been famously 
                            successful in games like checkers, chess, and Go—to imperfect information games. With a study 
                            published in Science in March 2017, DeepStack became the first AI capable of beating professional 
                            poker players at heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.<br><br>

                        <p> The AIIDE 2018 workshop on 'Learning to Play: The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmO (MARLO) Competition' aims to encourage research towards more general AI approaches through multi-player games. Games have a long and fruitful history of both serving as test beds to push AI research forward and being the first to benefit from novel research developments. It is our belief that this is the right time to focus on multi-player games in the more complex and diverse 3D environments provided by modern video games such as Minecraft. </p>
                            <p> The problem of learning in multi-agent settings is one of the fundamental problems in artificial intelligence research and poses unique research challenges. For example, the presence of independently learning agents can result in non-stationarity, and the presence of adversarial agents can hamper exploration and consequently the learning progress. In addition to being particularly challenging, progress in multi-agent learning has far-ranging application potential, in particular in modern multi-player video games, where novel AI agents have great potential to enable novel game experiences.</p>
                            <p> A key feature of multi-agent play in video game settings is a rich diversity of tasks. Modern video games consist of varied maps or levels, all spanned by the theme of the game but varying in interesting and surprising ways. Such diversity poses the challenge of learning to generalize across multiple related tasks. Exciting research on multi-task learning has addressed some of these challenges, but key questions remain. How well can state of the art approaches learn to generalize to variants of a previously learned game?</p>
                            <p> Goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners with diverse backgrounds in artificial intelligence and gaming, to provide a ground for the fruitful exchange of ideas to help start tackling these exciting key challenges associated with multi-task, multi-agent game settings.</p>
                            <p> <b>Topics: </b></p>

                            <p> The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmÖ (MARLÖ) competition is a new challenge that proposes research on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using multiple games. Participants would create learning agents that will be able to play multiple 3D games as deﬁned in the MalmÖ platform built on top of Minecraft. The aim of the competition is to encourage AI research on more general approaches via multi-player games. For this, the challenge will consist of not one but several games, each one of them with several tasks of varying diﬃculty and settings. Some of these tasks will be public and participants will be able to train on them. Others, however, will be private, only used to determine the ﬁnal rankings of the competition.
                            </p>
                            <p> A framework will be provided with easy instructions to install, create the ﬁrst agent and submit it to the competition server. Documentation, tutorials and sample controllers for the development of entries will also be accessible to the participants of this challenge. The competition will be hosted on CrowdAI.org, which will determine the preliminary rankings of the competition. Recurring tournaments at regular intervals will determine which agents perform better in the games proposed. This competition will be sponsored by Microsoft Research for framework development and competition awards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the main features of this competition is that agents play in multiple games. Therefore, several tasks are
                                proposed for this contest. For the purpose of this document and the competition itself, we deﬁne:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="col-lg-offset-1">
                                <li>Game: each one of the diﬀerent scenarios in which agents play. </li>
                                <li>Task: each instance of a game. Tasks, within a game, may be diﬀerent to each other in terms of level layout, size, diﬃculty and other game-dependent settings.</li>
                             </ul>
                            <p> The next figure sketches how games and tasks are organized in the challenge. As can be seen, tasks will be of public nature and accessible by the participants, while others are secret and will be used to evaluate the submitted entries at the end of the competition. Tasks are distributed across sets:
